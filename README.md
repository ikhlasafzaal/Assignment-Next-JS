## Assignment 4 & 5: Create a Blogging Website

### 📝 Assignment Details:
Your task is to create a fully responsive blogging website that meets the following requirements:

1. **Homepage**: Display a minimum of 6 blogs on the homepage. Each blog should have its own title, brief description, and image (if possible).

2. **Blog Details Page**: When a user clicks on a blog, it should navigate to a detailed blog page with full content.

3. **Animations**: Use keyframe and transition animations to enhance the user experience.

4. **Color Palette**: Apply color theory principles when selecting your color palette to ensure the website is visually appealing and cohesive.

5. **Layout**: The header and footer should remain static in the layout (i.e., they must be part of a shared layout file).

6. **Responsiveness**: Ensure the design is fully responsive, providing a smooth experience.


Hope this brings out the creativity in your design!
